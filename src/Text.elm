- The **Download** button will download
the current selection to a text file
`notes.yaml` which represents the
selection in yaml form.  Thus the notes
you create are not hostage to the system.

- Key commands:
  - ^B: Switch to browse mode
  - ^E: Edit the current note
  - ^M: Display (or hide) the manual
  - ^N: New note
  - ^U: Sort by decreasing modification time
  - ^V: Sort by increasing modification time
